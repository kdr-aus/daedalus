Daedalus is a data _rendering_ and data _manipulation_ tool enabling **powerful**, **insightful**, and **fast** reporting.

Check it out at https://daedalus.report

## Getting Started

This Github repository acts as a location to download and raise development requests for
`daedalus`. The documentation and templates can be found via the main website.

[Here is a link straight to the documentation][docs], which also acts as a showcase for what
`daedalus` is about.

## Local Installation

This repository hosts binaries for _local_ `daedalus` instances, intended for **fast** reporting
building and for users who want to use the REPL functionality.

### Requirements
`daedalus` does not require any dependencies to run, however for an optimal experience
using `daedalus`, it is recommended that:
1. A high quality text editor is installed. `daedalus` has support for [`vscode`].
2. [Firefox] or [Google Chrome] is used as the rendering browser.

## Getting started
First download the `zip` file of the [latest release](https://github.com/kdr-aus/daedalus/releases).
It is recommended to use a `stable` release. Extract the contents of the archive and run the executeable
`daedalus.exe`. If Windows Smart Screen is enabled you may be blocked from executing
the file. Please contact your system administrator to allow you to run the software.
Once `daedalus` is running, please refer to [the documentation][docs] for usage guides.

> Once `daedalus` installs itself, the application should be accessed from the start menu.
> _If `daedalus.exe` is run again, `daedalus` will re-install itself_.

## Support Development

issue](https://github.com/kdr-aus/daedalus/issues) or [join the
forums](https://forum.daedalus.report/) and add your voice to the `daedalus` community.
